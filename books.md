Design Journal for Exploring Identity


Last Semester
-------------

So with the start of a new semester I all ways like to look back on what I have done in the last semester before I start with this semester. I found that the last semester was different for me as I was being challanged in ways that I have not been before. With this course it up to you alone to come up with ideas and see them through, but last semester I found it hard to find anything in my brain worth even thinking about. This could have just been me, as usually very hard on myself and after a while when you tell yourself that you have nothing to give it seems that you stop giving. 

So with that thought in mind I want now to look at the first and work that I handed in, this was the John Baskerville project that last half the semester. With this project we learnt the basics of html and css through the us of doing itterations of the project. Each week we learnt a couple of things and we apllyed them to a new version of the webpage. Over all we had seven version were we practiced what we had learnt the day before, this then all lead to a finally version were we took what we learnt and made something on our own.

I wanted to give each section of text room to breathe so I decided to put a space in between each section. There is a term for it but I can not remember it at all. What I like most about this site is the title part as it visually jumps out at you and grabs your attention. When I was makeing this I was invisioning the busines card style, I even went all Patrick Batemen on it. I would have loved to push it further to see what it would have looked like but I just couldn't find a way to bring my ides to light. So I went for a basic busines card with only the letters looking letter pressed into the card. I done this by simple adding a shadow to the text in css. 

Project 1- Personal Identity 
------

With week one starting we wasted no time jumping into our new projects for this semester. So this module is all about exlporing identity, ours and corporate identitys. We are stating of looking at our own identity first as this will give us grounding on how we present our selfs to clients etc. So with this we are given the task of creating a monogram for our selves. What is a monogram? you may ask, but fear not as I have the answer

A monogram is the combing/ overlaping of two our more initils of a persons name. This then cam become their logo which they use to present themselves to people. So in my case it going to be Z,A amd R the letter wich will woven together seamlessly.

So when I was doing some research for this and another project I came across a really nice monogram for guy called [Charlie Waite](http://www.charliewaite.com/home). I can't find it apart from on his website so you will have to go there and have a look at it. I love how the two letter combine perfectly and what I just realised is that the 'W' is actualy making the circle which is a nice thouch. I just fell that this is a perfect example of a simple but efective monogram. Now what does it mean, does the circle represent him as a person who is complete and the letters edging forward does that say he is all ways on the go, looking to come up with more ideas.

There are more famouse ones that you will know of like the Channel logo, the Louis Vuitton, the Gucci and even the MTV logo is a monogram. Though I am going to try and stay away from these as they are representing a compainies voice not an individual.

With this I got stuck into a massive Google search which lasted long than I care to amite. Though I started to find really nice personal monograms that were just amazing. The monogram below was one of the first ones I saw and I like the detail that was put into it. As you have the two letters 'A' and 'M' combined but I like the use of line wight to signify the letters more clearly. A for the 'A' it is knowen that the downword stroke to the right can thicker. Now this might be a company, but I couldn't find one using this monogram, but to me it fells more personal that the proper comapny monograms.

So I then went on and found this one below. I think someone just had a clever idea for a monogram and made it as there was no one using it. So in this monogram tou can clearly see that there is an 'H' and 'A' in it. What I like about this is the conjoinment of the two letters, it has been done so simple but it works so well. I also like the font that was used in it with the serif bits lining up to make stright lines. Then the colour scheme that has been used to me makes it fell that the monogram is on the moon.

I have more to add here don't you worry.

Monogram
--------

Below you can see what looks like doodles and thats what it is. As soon as we were told to make monograms my hand grew a mind of its own just writing out 'ZAR' in different ways I could think of. I know there is not many different ways but I can all ready see some potential ones coming through.

![H and A Monogram](img/second_sketchs.png)

Then this was when we were given time to think up of ones. I at that moment had no plan/ grid paper so I was stuck with lined. I managed though to get ideas down onto the page. As you can see I was leaning towards the "ZAR" that has the words 'different colours' around it. For me at this time I could invision this being used at different angles and it still being readable. I could then make it a spining animation on my website to tie in with it being all ways different.

![H and A Monogram](img/third_sketchs.png)

You can see here that I have brought the idea above into Illustrator and its not turned out how I hopped. Know I probably could have worked with it and made it look nicer but at this time I had something else in the works which was a lot simpler but more effective. You can see this in the top left corner but this was the first initial try at it but as I looked at it something anoyed me about it. I then just for the fun of it made a few other ones but this is as far as the went.

![H and A Monogram](img/logo-try-1.png)

Unfortantly I have missplaced some of my sketchs so I will have to skip right to the end more and less. So below is my wordmark coming to it finial form. As you can see I had two different ways I could do it. The one in the top left was the way I initial thought of doing it but then I thought that it would look better all being the same. So I decided to make the letter out of five by five grid anf only use a small triangle to make the letter. In my opinion I think this works perfect you can make out each letter and it doesn't look to bad either. I went for this monogram as it uses one of the building blocks from design and it so simple but effective. I then started to over lap them a bit and I started to get an interesting result as you can see. I like how you can still make out the letters below with the sutile colour change on the letters when the are all on top of each other.

![H and A Monogram](img/logo-try-2.png)

Now below is the monogram in different colours I still wanted to bring the other idea into this stage as I still liked it and wanted to see what it would look like. What I like about this monogram is that it can take on any colout scheme and still look all right. I have also thought of a cool business card that I could have, all I need is to buy good card and cut then into business card size. Once I have done this I just need to cut ot the triangles to make the monogram and thats it. I then thought it would be funny to carry around a personalised stamp that has my twitter on it etc. So when I give it to someone I can be like her let me stamp that for you and it could be used as a talking point.

![H and A Monogram](img/versions.png)

Sense I went with a five by five grid I decided to have a side project and started to make an alphabet from this. As you can see I have more and less got all letters done apart from a few and I fell that they are all readable. I sadly have not taken this any further, though I don't know why as it shouldn't take me that long.

Wordmark
--------

This is the first idea that I had for my word mark. I all ways want to make the 'Z' stand out as its such a uniqe letter to have in you name. So I wanted to make it big and have my surname 'Reid' to be housed inside it more and less. So as you can se I started to do some sort of hand lettering versions and not as at the time I was confused. So out of these the one I like the most it the second top right one. I just liked how the 'Z' and 'Reid' worked to geather.


![H and A Monogram](img/first_wordm.png)

Now that I found what style I was going for I thought it would be best to think about the littler detail in it. As you can see I have start to make notes about what needs to be changed and what I like. At this moment in time I was loving this wordmark I thought it was me all over.

![H and A Monogram](img/second_wordm.png)

This is then me just again trying out different ways to make it look the best I still couldn't get somethings to work out the way I wanted them to. Though at this time I made a change to the monogram. I wanted to add another layer to it by making it look like ribion type.

![H and A Monogram](img/wordmark_s.png)

Again this is me just trying out different 'Z' trying to get it to work with the ribion type. 

![H and A Monogram](img/different_z.png)

Once again this is me still stuck on the 'Z' and trying to get it working and looking corectly.

![H and A Monogram](img/wordmark_s2.png)

At this moment in time I was ready to change my name as it just wasn't working out anymore. AS you can see it still looks a bit of and even when I tryed to take this into Illustrator to make it cleaner I was more and less free drawing it. I am not that good yet with the pen tool so I am sad to say I had to give up on this idea and try a new approch.
