            <p class="p_1">Hi, my name is <span class="zack">Zack Reid</span>. I am 19 years old who is currently studying IxD at The University of Ulster. Although this is my first year at IxD it is actually my second year at university, I spent a year doing IMD and as the course progressed I realised that it want for me.</p>

            <p class="p_2">So now I have embarked on a new ADVENTURE. As I embarked on this adventure I have realised more and more that the one thing I really wanted to be was a DESIGNER. I like the coding side but I get more enjoyment in plucking something out of my head and turning it into a thing I can see. This can both be graphic and for the web though I am starting to pull more towards graphic.</p>

            <p>You can see to the left what makes ME at this very moment. I have all ways had a passion for photography and filmography from a young age as I grew up in a house where it was appreciated and encouraged, as I got older and into this course I realised that I had a desire to create and that was when I was going to university.</p>
        
        <h3>Interest's</h3>
        
            <p>Over the last few years I started to realise that I needed to become healthier. Since then I have been running, lifting weights and trying to ride my bike as much as I can. I am already feeling fitter than I have ever been in my life, now it's just a matter of keeping it up.</p>

            <p>Throughout my life music has been in it. I would say I have a very wide range in terms of what music I listen to. This can be anything from Arctic Monkeys to Beethoven and everything in-between. My favourite band at the moment is The Fleet Foxes.</p>

            <p>You will find out in a bit that I studied Moving Image Arts and this lead me to really appreciate good movies and cinematography and even some of the not so good ones. My favourite director at the moment is Wes Anderson as he is pushing the film industry in a creative way, I love all of his movies but I would say his newest movie The Grand Budapest Hotel is my favourite movie of his </p>

             <p>As I said earlier photography has been around me sense I was a child. when I was in Upper Sixth I got the opportunity to do the GCSE photography and got an A in it. I like all types of images and painting with light using long exposures is something that I was really fascinated with and I get great pleasure seeing the images come to life.</p>
        
        <p>The biggest goal in my life is to travel around the world. I have all ready been backpacking around Europe and I loved every moment of it. This trip has only fuled my desire travel more and see different countries and experience other cultures.</p>

        <h3>Why Pick Me?</h3>
        
         <p>The reason I feel you should pick me for this adventure is because I am slowly evolving into a designer of sorts and I am starting to get to grips with how all this works. I feel it would help me enormously if I was under the guidance of the Fresh Made Media team and I would become a better designer for it. If I was fortunate enough to have this opportunity I would not waste my time, I would be constantly looking to improve in all aspects if interaction design. I would hope by the time the placement ends I would be a better designer become more proficient at using the required software and have a fuller understanding of the business side of things.
