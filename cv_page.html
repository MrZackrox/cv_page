        <h3 id="about">About</h3>

            <p class="p_1"> Hi, my name is <span class="zack">Zack Reid</span>. I am a 19 year old who is currently studying IxD at The University of Ulster. I am currently in my first year of the course but its actually my second year at university. As I was on a course called IMD but I found out after a year that the course was not for me.</p>

            <p class="p_2"> So now I have imbarked on a new ADVENTURE. On this adventure I have realised one thing I want to be a DESIGNER. I like the coding side but I find more injoyment in plucking somthing out of my head and turning it into a thing I can see. This can both be graphic and for the web though I am starting to pull more towards graphic.</p>

            <p>You can see to the left what makes ME at this very moment. I have all ways had a passion for photography and filmography from a young age as I grew up in a house were it was important to us. Then as I got older and into this course I realised that I had a desire to create and that when I was going to uni.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Interest's</h3>
        
            <p>I am a healthy person, not in what I eat but I run, lift wights and try to ride my bike as much as I can. I am all ready fitter than I have ever been in my life, now it just a matter of keeping it up.</p>

                 <img src="img/bike.png" class="bike">

            <p>The biggest goal in my life is to travel around the world. I have all ready been backpacking around Europe and I loved every moment of it. This trip has only fuled my desire to see the other countries I haven't seen.</p>

            <p>Through out my life music has been in it. I would say I have a very wide range in terms of what music I listien to. This an be from Artic Monkeys too Beethoven and everything inbetween.</p>

            <p>As you know I done MIA which just tells you I will like a good movie, even the nost so good ones. </p>

            <p>Photography</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        
            <p>My first subject that made me think about the design of something was media. I picked this class for my GCSE and loved every moment of it. I loved how you could create something and it could target a certain TA with what type you use to the images on the cover. I then followed this on and done it for A-level, though at this time I got the opertunity to have Moving Image Arts as a class for A-level. Out of the two year's I learnt a great deal about, how you have to see five steps ahead in terms of what a ceratin camera angle will do for the film as a whole. During this time I pushed myself to be out of the box with my projects and I can happly say it succeed. For my last project in finial year I went all out and done a stop motion light painting video which was one of the most rewarding thing's I have done. I spent hours out in the cold getting five second of footage, though it was all worth it to see it fully complete. I would search for Rippled if you wan't to see my insiration for the project.</p>
